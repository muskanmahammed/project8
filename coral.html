                Coral reef ecosystems are intricate and diverse collections of species that interact with each other and the physical environment. Coral is a class of colonial animal that is related to hydroids,
                jellyfish, and sea anemones.Stony corals, a type of coral characterized by their hard skeleton, are the bedrock of the reef. Stony coral colonies are composed of hundreds of thousands of individual living polyps. 
                Polyps are capable of drawing dissolved calcium from seawater, and solidifying it into a hard mineral (calcium carbonate) structure that serves as their skeletal support

                Coral reefs provide habitat for a large variety of marine life, including various sponges, oysters, clams, crabs, sea stars, sea urchins, and many species of fish. 
                Coral reefs are also linked ecologically to nearby seagrass, mangrove, and mudflat communities.

                Corals can be found throughout the worldâ€™s oceans, in both shallow and deep water. However, the reef-building corals that rely on a symbiotic relationship with algae need shallow,
                clear water allowing light penetration for photosynthesis. Stony corals also require tropical or sub-tropical temperatures, 
                which exist in a band 30 degrees north to 30 degrees south of the equator.
