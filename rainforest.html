                Rainforests are Earth’s oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least
                70 million years. They are incredibly diverse and complex, home to more than half of the world’s plant
                and
                animal species—even though they cover just six percent of Earth’s surface. This makes rainforests
                astoundingly dense with flora and fauna; a 10-square-kilometer (four-square-mile) patch can contain as
                many
                as 1,500 flowering plants, 750 species of trees, 400 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies.

                Rainforests thrive on every continent except Antarctica. The largest rainforests on Earth surround the
                Amazon River in South America and the Congo River in Africa. The tropical islands of Southeast Asia and
                parts of Australia support dense rainforest habitats. Even the cool evergreen forests of North America’s
                Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe are a type of rainforest

                Rainforests’ rich biodiversity is incredibly important to our well-being and the well-being of our
                planet. Rainforests help regulate our climate and provide us with everyday products.

                Unsustainable industrial and agricultural development, however, has severely degraded the health of the
                world’s rainforests. Citizens, governments, intergovernmental organizations, and conservation groups are
                working together to protect these invaluable but fragile ecosystems.
